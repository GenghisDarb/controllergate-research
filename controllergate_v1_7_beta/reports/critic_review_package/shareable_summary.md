# ControllerGate shareable summary

ControllerGate is a proof-gated runtime and compiler layer for safe AI software repair.

Current evidence boundary: four confirmed external native repair episodes, zero confirmed issue-derived repair episodes, full scoring disabled, memory lift not demonstrated, and self-maintaining software not demonstrated.

Batch015 adds runtime-wrapper scaffold modules, a lock-sequence operation registry, claim tiers, a capability catalog, public positioning, and roadmap-only compiler directions. It does not claim production readiness or new repair evidence.

Batch017 attempts decision-time dependency-era resolution for Darker issue #112 and starts thin artifact packaging. It blocks rather than patching when no decision-time dependency lock is proven.

## Current operational gate status

- Current protocol remains `v2.13`.
- Confirmed external native repair episodes remain `4`.
- Confirmed issue-derived repair episodes remain `0`.
- Full scoring remains `NOT_RUN/disallowed`.
- Memory lift remains `not_demonstrated`.
- Self-maintaining software remains `false/not_demonstrated`.
- Batch015 adds a runtime-wrapper scaffold, lock-sequence registry, claim tiers, and product-positioning boundaries without live deployment.
- Batch016 addresses target-intent alignment for the issue-derived Darker seed and safe-stops before repair because the observed failure is pre-target/precondition.
- Batch017 attempts decision-time dependency-era resolution and starts thin artifact packaging; it safe-stops if no decision-time dependency lock can be proven.

## Batch039 secondary cofactor governance

- Batch039 ingests the official Batch038 artifact and preserves the verified target-resolution progress.
- The remaining blocker is classified as a declared but unpinned secondary cofactor, so provider materialization is blocked until a reviewed pinned lock exists.
- Missing secondary tooling is not counted as the original target failure or as repair success.
- Confirmed native repair episodes remain `4`; confirmed issue-derived repair episodes remain `0`.
- Full scoring remains `NOT_RUN/disallowed`; memory lift remains `not_demonstrated`; self-maintaining software remains `false/not_demonstrated`.

### Batch050 manual fresh-seed intake fast lane

- Batch050 status: `PASS_WITH_BATCH050_MANUAL_SEED_PACKAGE_REQUIRED`.
- Current protocol remains: `v2.14`.
- Manual seed package found: `false`.
- Approved unused issue seed count: `0`.
- Exact blocker: `manual_seed_artifact_absent`.
- Next allowed action: `provide_manual_seed_package`.
- Environment elbow classification: `source_acquisition_boundary`.
- Shell closure status: `open_waiting_for_fresh_seed`.
- External native repair episodes remain `4`; issue-derived repair episodes remain `1`.
- Batch050 is an intake/template gate only; repair generation, target replay, dependency install, full scoring, memory-lift claims, and production-readiness claims remain disabled.

### Batch051 Lemon Reader manual seed pre-repair replay gate

- Batch051 status: `PASS_WITH_BATCH051_PRE_REPAIR_REPLAY_BLOCKED`.
- Candidate approved: `true`.
- Approved unused issue seed count: `1`.
- Pre-repair replay status: `PASS_WITH_BATCH051_PRE_REPAIR_REPLAY_BLOCKED`.
- Exact blocker: `host_environment_not_ubuntu_latest_python311`.
- Next allowed action: `cofactor_or_environment_materialization_gate`.
- External native repair episodes remain `4`; issue-derived repair episodes remain `1`.
- Batch051 is a seed-approval and pre-repair replay gate only; repair generation, patch generation, duplicate replay, full scoring, memory-lift claims, and production-readiness claims remain disabled.
